# Electric Load Forecasting

I've put an IPython notebook file and two supporting CSV files into this repository.  You can [open the notebook](https://github.com/khslmr/electric-load-forecasting/blob/master/electric_demand_forecast_with_SMGP.ipynb) for viewing in Github (non-interactive) or download and open on your computer for an interactive session (you will need to install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)).
